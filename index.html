    <p class="Cat">The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat known for its 
        unique physical trait: folded ears. These cats have a genetic mutation 
        that causes their ear cartilage to fold forward, giving them an adorable 
        and distinctive appearance. Scottish Folds are typically medium-sized cats 
        with a rounded head, large expressive eyes, and a sweet, affectionate personality.</p>
